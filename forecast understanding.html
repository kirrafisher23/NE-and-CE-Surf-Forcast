    <h1>Forecast Understanding</h1>
   <div class="windUnderstanding">
    <h3>It is important to understand the wind directions; what they mean and how will they affect our surf. When the wind blows offshore, which is not very common when the waves are good in Florida, the wind is blowing from land to the ocean. 
        When surfing offshore conditions with winds greater 9 Kts it maybe a bit more difficult to paddle into a wave. Light offshores make for very fun and glassy conditions, but Florida normally doesnt have offshores with fun waves for that long. 
        When the wind is blowing onshore, the wind is coming from the sea and blowing towards the land. This is where most of our wind swells come from as these mainly come from cold-fronts or nor-easters the sit off our coastline. These make the waves have more of a "choppy" face, but wind swells can ber very fun. 
        If the onshores are too high however, it may be blown out and way too choppy for rideable conditions. When the wind blows crosshore/sideshore the winds either combine with an on or offshore wind direction or it can strictly blow north or south. If these winds blow too stong it can make it difficult to paddle into waves. Say you wanna take off on a left and the winds are blowing too hard south it will be difficult to paddle into or the wave is too weak. Same goes for going right when the winds blow too har north.
        When the crosshore/sideshore takes its dominance over a offshore or onshore wind direction there will be a HEAVY current. If the winds were to be NNE (north north east) expect a current taking you south. If its blowing hard SSE (south south east), expect a HEAVY current taking you north.</h3>

    <div class="swellPeriod">
        <h3>Swell periods are another fundamental thing to understand. These are measured in seconds and are the times in between for waves that pulse, and they occasionally work in tandem with the winds. If we have anything over a 10 second period, then there is a ground swell or a hurrincane swell in the ocean</h3>
